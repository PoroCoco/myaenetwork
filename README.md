# Common issues

## My computer ran out of memory when I try to use the program

For this there isn't any easy solutions, this means that your network information is too big for the computer memory. You can craft the higher tier memory and if this is still not enough you can craft a server and put it inside a rack which will allow you to use 4 sticks of RAM instead of 2. You cannot have more memory than this setup so if still runs out of memory you have to increase the memory amount of the RAM sticks in the opencomputer config file (or if using Computronics you can use the Creative Memory).
